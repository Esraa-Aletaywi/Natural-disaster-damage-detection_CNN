📌 Natural Disaster Damage Detection (CNN)

This repository contains my graduation project, which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite images of natural disasters into the following categories:

Drought

Earthquake

Hurricane

Landslide

Wild Fire

No Damage

The goal of this project is to support disaster response and risk assessment using deep learning techniques applied on remote sensing imagery.
